String and StringBuffer both are final classes in java.lang package.
there are two approach to create String object i.e with and without using new operator
There are only one approach to create StringBuffer object i.e with using new operator
What is difference between String s1 ="ratan" and String s2 = new String("Ratan")
when you create the object by using new operator, the objects are created in heap memory and without
using new operator object goes into scp(string constant pool) memory. In SCP evey object
have unique content i.e content are not repeated.
